Version 2


Hi everyone, we'll talking about how to make a pacman game in Python. Let's just jump right in.

### Intro - demo

IMPORTANT: Cut to chase!! Away with all the meta! People gonna figure all this out anyway
Commentary over live coding, to fit it all in.
You'll keep feeling it's not perfect.
Better ask for review before publishing.


[demo][final-game] Hey everyone. This video is about how to make you own pacman game in python, um from scratch. This one's the first in a series of 3 actually. I think games are a great way to learn programming, and console games are a great way to learn to make games, with all the graphics complexity out of the way. Python is an easy to learn object oriented programmimg language, and games are all about objects, so its fairly easy to see what you're doing.

So let's just get started.



### Screen switch - terminal

```bash
$
```
[terminal] Do check if python is installed in you system. If you need help doing that, there are links in the description that should get you running in no time.

We will be writing code that works on both python 2 and 3 so, its alright if you have either of them. I'll be running it from a Unix sytem which will work for Linux and macOS users. If you use Windows, there is description link that you can you to translate the commands.

All the code will be available on github, uh, the GitHub source link is also in the description, in case you wish to follow along with the ready code, though I highly recommend starting from zero code before you do that.
